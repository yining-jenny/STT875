# STT875 R Programing for Data Science


## Course Overview
Programming in R and use of associated Open Source tools. Addressing practical issues in workflow documentation, data management, and scientific computing.
The goal of this course is to applied theoretical aspects of R programming for data sciences. Topics cover generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in high-level languages such as R. Course content focuses on design and implementation of R programs to meet routine and specialized data manipulation/management and analysis objectives. Attention will also be given to mastering concepts and tools necessary for implementing reproducible research.

## Course Objective
Upon completion of this course should be able to:
• establish an efficient scientific computing environment
• identify and use available R packages and associated Open Source software to meet given
scientific objectives
• design and write efficient programs using R (and similar high-level languages) to perform
routine and specialized data manipulation/management and analysis tasks
• document, share, and collaborate on code development using a suite of Open Source standards
and tools
• document analytical workflow using R and markdown languages
